// suffix is a bare "User:" completion. A typed prefix looks like a
// finished user turn the *character* should answer — and the card's
// common "do not decide for {{user}}" line is still in the system
// prompt, so the model switches to the character's voice (Discord
// 2026-08-15). These blocks go in the SYSTEM zone first and, when a
// prefix exists, next to the suffix.
