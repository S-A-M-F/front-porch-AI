/// Plain (non-ChangeNotifier) prompt injection builder for author notes /
/// objective system text (primary + secondary/autonomous objectives with
/// task progress, injectionDepth-based intensity, always-present fixed
/// section so never budget-trimmed).
///
/// Extracted as step 8 of Stage 3 god-file modularization (prompt_injection/*).
/// The _getObjectiveInjection body moved verbatim here (adapted to cbs for
/// god-owned objective state: _activeObjectives, primary/secondary getters,
/// tasksForObjective method — these remain in god for now as objective_service
/// is later in the 15-order table).
///
/// ChatService owns via late final _authorNoteBuilder + thin delegation at
/// the single call site in prompt assembly. 0 @Deprecated shims (new surface).
/// 0 new private methods in god (thins + late final only).
///
/// No state owned (pure builder). Cross-state minimal (no group per-char
/// dispatch for objectives yet; objectives are chat/session scoped, with
/// per-char in group via god's setObjective etc).
///
/// Boundaries kept in god (per plan for step 8):
/// - Objective list management, CRUD (setObjective, etc), DB load/save,
///   _activeObjectives, primaryObjective/secondaryObjectives getters,
///   tasksForObjective, import seeding, _messagesSinceLastCheck stay in god
///   (objective_service extraction is step 11 after prompt_injection).
/// - The objectiveBlock assembly + "Must sit in a fixed prompt section"
///   comment + always-injection (independent of realism) stays thin in god.
/// - _getObjectiveInjection now thin delegation to builder (full logic here).
///
/// aug exercising only passive/qualified (no prompt-specific aug file edits;
/// objective load/greeting/regen paths hit by pre-existing in key suites;
/// full builder text only in dedicated + manual per smallest-mechanical
/// precedent from step7).
/// oneShot vs normal objective parity qualified (injection text used in both
/// paths via same assembly; dispatch preserved).
///
/// 8 prompt_injection builders total (this + relationship/emotion/behavioral/
/// time/nsfw/chaos/needs); this one maps the objective builder (named
/// author_note_builder per exact plan in docs/refactoring-guide.md).
