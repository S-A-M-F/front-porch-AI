A powerful, cross-platform desktop application designed to streamline the management of AI character cards and provide a seamless chat experience with **KoboldCPP**. Organize your collection, edit metadata, build worlds, and chat with your favorite characters in a modern, intuitive interface.

## ✨ Features

### 📇 Character Management
- **V2 Spec Support**: Fully compatible with the V2 character card specification (PNG & JSON).
- **Import & Export**: Easily import cards from other frontends or export your creations to share.
- **Metadata Editor**: Edit names, descriptions, personalities, scenarios, and first messages with a clean UI.
- **Lorebooks**: Create and attach extensive lorebooks to characters for deep world-building.
- **Organization**: Create virtual folders, tag characters, and use global search to manage large collections.
- **Tag Editor**: Manage tags directly from the Edit Character screen.
- **Web-to-Chat Import**: Direct integration with `aicharactercards.com` and `chub.ai` via an internal browser that intercepts downloads for instant auto-import.
- **V2 Smart Parsing**: Advanced V2 tEXt metadata extraction from PNG character cards.

### 💬 Immersive Chat Experience
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Tokens appear instantly as they are generated, eliminating perceived latency.
- **Rich Text Styling**: 
  - **Dialogue** is highlighted in amber for easy reading.
  - *Actions* and narrative text are subtly styled in grey.
- **Advanced Controls**:
  - **Regenerate**: Don't like a response? Roll again.
  - **Continue**: Let the AI keep talking from where it left off.
  - **Impersonate**: Have the AI write a message *as you* (the user).
  - **Stop Generation**: Immediately halt AI generation mid-stream with one click.
  - **Message Editing**: Edit any message (User or AI) in-place to polish the narrative or fix typos.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Your chat history is automatically saved and restored when you switch characters.
- **System Prompt Library**: Save and switch between multiple system prompts. Includes a specialized "Immersive Roleplay" default.
- **User Personas**: Define your own persona name and description to influence how characters interact with you.

### ⚙️ KoboldCPP Integration
- **Automated Management**: The app can automatically download and update the KoboldCPP backend for you.
- **Hardware Detection**: Automatically detects GPU and VRAM. Prefers **Vulkan** on PC and **Metal** on Apple Silicon. Now supports **Intel ARC** and shared memory GPUs.
- **macOS Stability**: Native quarantine management and sandbox-free execution for seamless backend launches.
- **Model Hub**: Built-in integration with HuggingFace to search for and download GGUF models directly.
- **Process Management**: Robustly handles the lifecycle of the AI backend, ensuring clean shutdowns.

### 🌍 World Building
- **World Info**: Create shared lore that can be referenced by multiple characters.
- **Dynamic Context**: World info is injected into the context based on keywords, ensuring the AI knows about your world without overloading the context window.
