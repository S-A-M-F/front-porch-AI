## 🔓 Why Open Source?

Proprietary software lives and dies at the discretion of its creators. When a company moves on, shuts down, or simply loses interest, the tools you depend on become frozen in time — no updates, no fixes, no future.

Front Porch AI is proudly licensed under the **GPL v3** because we believe your tools should belong to the community that uses them. If this project is ever abandoned, anyone can fork it, improve it, and keep it alive. Open source isn't just a license — it's a promise that the software will always have a future.


## 🆕 What's New in V0.8.1

- 🐛 **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed custom installation directory breaking the 0.8.0 database — the DB, character PNGs, and all data files now correctly follow the user-configured install path
  - Changing install directory in Settings now properly relocates all data (database, characters, chats, worlds, models) to the new location and cleans up the old directory
  - Fixed data migration from 0.7.2 JSON format failing when a custom install directory was set — character and folder migrations now respect the custom path
  - Legacy JSON files from pre-0.8.0 (chat sessions, group chats, worlds, folder config) are now automatically cleaned up after migration

### What's New in V0.8.0

- 🔄 **Row-Level Merge Engine**: Cloud sync now performs intelligent per-row merging instead of whole-database replacement. Conflicts are resolved using `updatedAt` timestamps, preserving the most recent changes from either device.
- 🆔 **UUID Primary Keys**: All tables (Characters, Folders, Messages, Sessions, Worlds) now use UUID primary keys instead of auto-increment integers. This eliminates ID collisions when merging data from multiple devices.
- 💾 **Backup Management**: Full backup system with manual and automatic backups before each cloud sync. Restore any backup with one click, or delete individual backups you no longer need. Up to 5 recent backups are kept automatically.
- ☁️ **Dedicated Cloud Sync Page**: Cloud sync settings have been moved from the Settings page to their own dedicated sidebar page for easier access. Includes sync controls, provider configuration, cloud character browser, and backup management.
- 🔼 **Force Upload Database**: New disaster recovery option to overwrite the cloud database with your local copy — useful after restoring a backup.
- 🗑️ **Purge Cloud Data**: Nuclear option to wipe all cloud data (database + character PNGs) when recovery isn't possible. Local data is never affected.
- 🛡️ **Smarter Initial Sync**: First sync after migration now uploads local data as source of truth instead of merging, preventing duplicate entries caused by independent UUID migrations on different devices.
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed KoboldCPP child processes not being killed on app close (Linux) — orphaned processes no longer consume GPU memory after exit
  - Fixed Google Drive cloud sync failing to upload character PNGs due to stale folder ID cache — all characters now sync reliably
  - Individual character upload failures no longer abort the entire sync batch
  - Orphaned character PNGs (from deleted characters or DB sync) are now automatically cleaned up after cloud sync
  - Re-importing a character no longer creates duplicate PNG files on disk

- 🛡️ **Smarter Initial Sync**: First sync after migration uploads local data as source of truth.

### What's New in V0.8.0-beta3

- 📦 **Backyard AI (.byaf) Importer**: Import characters directly from Backyard AI archive files. Full preview dialog shows persona, lore items, first message, and avatar before import. Optionally import chat history. Automatically converts `{user}` / `{character}` placeholders to V2 spec `{{user}}` / `{{char}}`.
- 📡 **Model Loading Status Bar**: Real-time status bar at the bottom of the home screen shows what KoboldCPP is doing while loading a model (loading, mapping to memory, warming up). A snackbar notification appears when the model is ready to chat.
- 🖱️ **Right-Click Context Menu**: Character card actions (edit, chat, delete, move to folder) are now accessed via a right-click context menu for a cleaner card layout.
- ☁️ **Cloud Sync Reliability**: Rewrote the database sync strategy (close → download → reopen) for better cross-platform reliability. Fixed data loss during path rebasing and improved empty-DB download priority.
- ⏱️ **Buffer Duration Setting**: New slider in Chat Settings to control how many seconds of tokens to buffer before the display starts draining (1–10s). Higher values give smoother output; lower values reduce the initial delay.
- 🛑 **Smarter Stop Sequences**: Added `</END>`, `[END]`, and `<|end|>` as essential stop sequences. Existing users receive them automatically via migration — no manual setup needed.
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed stop generation not always halting the backend
  - Fixed model picker in chat view not updating correctly
  - Fixed session upsert causing duplicate entries
  - Fixed cross-platform character loading after cloud sync
  - Character creation now properly imports into the SQL database
  - Fixed `{{user}}` resolving to "User" instead of the active persona name in the sidebar

### What's New in V0.8.0-beta2

- 🗄️ **SQLite Database Backend**: All data storage has been migrated from scattered JSON files to a fast, reliable SQLite database powered by **Drift ORM**. Characters, chat sessions, messages, groups, folders, personas, and worlds — all in one `front_porch.db` file.
- 📊 **Migration Progress Dialog**: First-time launch after the update shows a polished full-screen overlay with step names, progress bar, and step counter while your existing JSON data is imported into the database.
- ☁️ **Simplified Cloud Sync**: Cloud sync now uploads/downloads a single `.db` file instead of hundreds of individual JSON files. Faster, more reliable, and no more out-of-sync data.
- 🧹 **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed ~200 lines of orphan cleanup, per-file JSON sync, and dual-write code. The database is now the single source of truth.


### What's New in V0.8.0-beta

- ☁️ **Cloud Sync (Alpha)**: Sync your characters, chat sessions, folder layouts, and user personas across devices. An alpha-stage warning now appears when enabling the feature.
