// "Current Task / Quest" is retired from character authoring; Ambitions took
// its place (approved Porch Life sketch §4).
//
// The two boxes sat next to each other and asked for the same kind of sentence,
// which is why authors typed a per-chat errand ("find the missing artifact")
// into a field baked permanently into the card. A quest belongs to a chat and
// lives in the sidebar's Objectives panel; an ambition belongs to the character
// and spans every chat they are ever in. Only one of those is a card property.
//
// This pins the swap where a user can see it: the editor offers ambitions and
// no longer offers the task box. The card FIELD survives untouched — see
// authored_task_import_test.dart for the half that keeps old cards whole.
