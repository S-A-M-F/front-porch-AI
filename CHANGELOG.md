# Changelog

All notable changes to Front Porch AI will be documented in this file.

## [V0.5.0] - 2026-02-17

### ✨ New Features
- **Group Chat (Pre-Alpha)**: Create multi-character group chats with 2+ characters. Characters interact with each other and with the user in a shared conversation.
  - **Round Robin & Free-Form Turn Order**: Choose between structured round-robin turns or dynamic free-form conversations.
  - **Auto-Advance**: Toggle automatic character responses — characters respond one after another without user input.
  - **AI-Generated Scenarios**: ✨ Generate button produces a concise 1-2 sentence scenario from character personalities.
  - **AI-Generated First Messages**: ✨ Generate button creates a vivid multi-paragraph opening scene based on the scenario and characters, with dialogue, actions, and sensory details.
  - **Pre-Alpha Warning Dialog**: Users are notified about the experimental nature of group chat before creating one.
  - **Group Chat Persistence**: Group chats are saved and restored between sessions via `GroupChatRepository`.
- **Generation Presets**: Quick-access preset chips (Creative, Balanced, Precise, Deterministic) in the Generation Settings dialog for one-tap parameter profiles.
- **Chat Text Colorization Improvements**: Fixed multi-line `*action*` block detection with `dotAll` regex, ensuring correct blue/amber coloring across line breaks.
- **Thinking Model Support**: Automatic `<think>...</think>` block stripping for thinking models (e.g., GLM5) that emit reasoning chains in output.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure
- **Package Rename**: Renamed package from `kobold_character_card_manager` to `front_porch_ai` across the entire codebase.
- **Installer Fix**: Resolved Windows installer exe name mismatch (`front_porch_ai.exe` → `Front Porch AI.exe`).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Stop sequences (`END SCENE`, `---`, `[END]`) added to AI generation to prevent abrupt cutoffs.
- Reasoning/planning text automatically filtered from generated content.
- Fixed `<think>` tag leakage from thinking-enabled models in generated first messages.

## [v0.0.3.4] - 2026-02-16

### ✨ New Features
- **Smooth Output Buffer**: Intelligent token buffering system that delivers AI responses at a consistent, readable pace regardless of hardware speed.
  - Adaptive TPS measurement using a rolling 3-second window — responds to speed fluctuations in real-time.
  - Optimal buffer formula (`maxTokens × (1 - genTps / targetTps)`) starts display as early as mathematically possible without interruptions.
  - Auto-pause & rebuild: if generation speed drops mid-response, display pauses briefly and re-buffers to maintain smooth flow.
  - Real-time tokens-per-second counter shown in the generation bar.
- **Configurable Display Speed**: New settings in Chat Settings dialog:
  - Toggle smooth output buffer on/off (no-buffer mode for raw streaming).
  - Slider to set target display speed (5–60 t/s, default 6 t/s ≈ 250 WPM average human reading speed).
- **Alt Greetings in Character Creator**: Add alternate greeting messages when creating new characters.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fix `{{char}}` placeholder replacement being inconsistent across cards and chat.
- Fix sidebar title truncation on long character names.
- Fix backend auto-start race condition by awaiting StorageService initialization.

### 📝 Documentation
- Added open source philosophy and community links (Discord, Matrix) to README.
- Added screenshots inline with feature sections.
- Added Smooth Output Buffer feature documentation.
